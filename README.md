The **Open Fermentation Project SPC** allows for the non-commercial use of everything!

## The Hardware

We have opened up the design and are providing complete instructions on how to build the Saluminator&reg; Fermenation device. We encourage folks to build one for themselves!

The only restriction is that we ask that you do not apply the Saluminator&reg; Trademark for any commercial projects, products or collateral without our express written consent.

## The Software

Recipes in the Saluminator&reg; are fixed with a starting time and a ending time. The time between is the “Recipe Cycle” and it can be as simple as one set of settings applied to the whole fermentation cycle or more complex with three(3) phases in the cycle automatically managed by the device's automation software.

# Mission Statement

## OUR MISSION

The **Open Fermentation Project SPC** exists to make automated fermentation accessible to all. Fermentation makes food more nutritious and is a process likely used to create some of your favorite foods and drinks. Inspired by artisans and foodies alike, we give you the tools you need to engineer your personal getaway to artisanal food. The result is artisan-level produces that help people stay healthy.

## OUR STORY

Launched in 2022, the **Open Fermentation Project SPC** began with a simple vision: to make automated fermentation more accessible.

It all began several years ago when I started to develop a unique software and hardware with the goal to open source it. I wanted anyone with basic engineering skills to be able to put together our system. Little did I know, it was the beginning of the **Open Fermentation Project SPC**.

Today, our hallmark product is the “Saluminator&reg;” — an appliance that promises to bring precision curing and fermentation to home and custom curing chambers. We offer everything from complete DIY kits to fully assembled Saluminators to allow you to cure meats and other recipes that require temperature, humidity and time control. Recipe management is the core of the Saluminator&reg; IoT Management Automation System and we have worked closely with design experts on perfecting its user interface.

As proponents of open design, we have proudly made our design accessible and encourage everyone to build one of their own. We share all the details with you and invite you to follow our step-by-step instructions that make integration flawless.

Through open design, we have also grown to be a full-fledge community where hundreds of people come together to make automated fermentation more accessible. Our people are at the heart of what we do and allow us to further our mission. We believe that food and technology must work together to further the food industry for the better.

As we continue to grow, we promise to continue to make automated fermentation more accessible. The Open Fermentation Project is a food tech company. Moreover, it’s a place for a community of foodies — just like you and I.
