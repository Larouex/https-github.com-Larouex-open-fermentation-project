## Welcome!

The Open Fermentation Project is...

- Reference Hardware for an Industrial IoT "Internet of Things" Fermentation Appliance
- The Automation Software to Manage a Fermentation Recipe Lifecycle
- Cloud Integration for Telemetry and Monitoring

## The Hardware

The curing appliance is branded and trademarked as the "Saluminator" and was developed by Larry W Jordan Jr for Larouex Gourmet Foods LLC. The trademark is registered for commercial projects.

We have opened up the design and how to build the device and you are encouraged to build one for yourself and the only restriction is that you do not pally the Saluminator our trademark for any commercial projects or usage.

We developed this appliance to bring precision curing and fermentation to home and custom curing chambers. The entire project is based on “open source” software and “open and available” components that anyone with basic engineering skills could put together our system. We share this all with you and you are welcome to just use the instructions here to build your system and/or we are happy to sell you everything you need from a complete DIY kit to everything fully assembled and ready to install.

We designed the Saluminator for the production of fermented products and specifically for the automation of dry curing meats and other recipes that require control over temperature, humidity and time. Connected to the power of the cloud and through the acquisition of stream telemetry and machine learning, the Saluminator IoT Automation tunes itself to variances in the ambient environment and the characteristics of your specific curing chamber
